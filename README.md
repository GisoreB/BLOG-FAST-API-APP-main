# BLOG-FAST-API-APP

A modern, scalable, and production-ready FastAPI application designed to manage users, posts, and votes with high efficiency. This project leverages best practices in API development, incorporating automated testing, continuous integration, and continuous deployment to ensure reliability and maintainability. It demonstrates a robust architecture for building high-performance APIs, with a focus on security, containerization, and cloud deployment. The application is optimized for real-world use cases, ensuring seamless scalability and ease of maintenance.

## 🚀 Features

- **User Management**: Create, retrieve, and manage users with secure authentication.
- **Post Management**: Full CRUD operations for posts with ownership validation.
- **Voting System**: Users can upvote or remove votes on posts.
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication using OAuth2 and JWT tokens.
- **Database Integration**: SQLModel and Alembic for database modeling and migrations.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests using `pytest`.
- **OWASP Top 10 Security**: This project incorporates key OWASP Top 10 security practices, such as secure authentication using OAuth2 and JWT, preventing SQL injection through SQLModel, and enforcing proper access control to ensure users can only interact with their own data. Tests are included to validate these protections and ensure the application is resilient to common security vulnerabilities..
- **Containerization**: Docker support for seamless development and production environments.
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions and Render.
- **API Documentation**: Interactive API documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc.

## 🧪 Testing

## This project includes a robust test suite to ensure the reliability of the application. Both **unit tests** and **integration tests** are implemented to validate individual components and their interactions.

### Running Tests

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest -v -s
   ```

### Test Coverage

#### Unit Tests

- **Users**:
  - User creation and validation.
  - Token generation and authentication.
- **Posts**:
  - CRUD operations for posts.
  - Ownership validation.
- **Votes**:
  - Adding and removing votes.
  - Duplicate vote handling.

#### Integration Tests

Integration tests validate the interaction between multiple components, such as database operations, authentication, and API endpoints.

Example: Integration test for creating a post and voting on it:

```python
# filepath: tests/test_integration.py
import pytest

def test_create_post_and_vote(client, test_user, token_headers):
    # Create a post
    response = client.post(
        "/posts/",
        json={"title": "Integration Test Post", "content": "This is a test."},
        headers=token_headers,
    )
    assert response.status_code == 201
    post_id = response.json()["id"]

    # Vote on the post
    vote_response = client.post(
        "/vote/",
        json={"post_id": post_id, "dir": 1},
        headers=token_headers,
    )
    assert vote_response.status_code == 201
    assert vote_response.json()["message"] == "Vote added successfully"
```
